**🚗 TASK 3:  Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

The aim of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of cars based on various features using Python.



**📁 Dataset**

1. car data.csv
2. The dataset includes information such as car year, fuel type, transmission, seller type, and other attributes used to predict the selling price.



**🛠️ Libraries Used**

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Scikit‑learn



**🔍 Project Workflow**

**1. Data Loading \& Inspection**

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Displayed initial rows, dataset information, and checked for missing values



**2. Feature Engineering**

Converted car manufacturing year into Car Age

Removed unnecessary columns such as car name

Prepared data for model training



**3. Data Preprocessing**

Encoded categorical variables using one‑hot encoding

Split the dataset into features and target variable (Selling Price)



**4. Model Training**

Divided data into training and testing sets

Trained a Linear Regression model



**5. Model Evaluation**

* Evaluated model performance using:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score



**6. Visualization**

Plotted Actual vs Predicted Selling Prices to visualize model accuracy



**7. Sample Prediction**

Predicted the selling price of a sample car from the dataset



**📈 Key Learnings**

* Feature engineering and data preprocessing
* Handling categorical data
* Building and evaluating regression models
* Understanding prediction errors and model accuracy



**📌 Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a practical approach to solving a real‑world problem using machine learning. It highlights the complete workflow from data preparation to model evaluation using Python.
