**🌸 Iris Flower Classification (Task 1)**



This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship and focuses on building a simple machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using a custom dataset.



**📌 Project Overview**



The goal of this project is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is used for this task.



**📂 Dataset**



* File used: iris.csv
* Target column: Species
* Features: All numerical flower measurements
* The target labels are encoded into numerical form before training the model.



🛠️ **Technologies Used**



* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn



⚙️ **Workflow**



* Load the dataset using Pandas
* Separate features and target variable
* Encode species labels using LabelEncoder
* Split the data into training and testing sets
* Train a KNN classifier
* Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report



📊 **Model Evaluation**



The model performance is evaluated using:

* Accuracy score
* Confusion matrix
* Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)



🚀 **Outcome**



The model successfully classifies Iris flower species with good accuracy, demonstrating the basics of supervised machine learning and classification.
