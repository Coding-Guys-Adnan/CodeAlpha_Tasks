**📊 Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python**

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

The goal of this task is to analyze unemployment trends in India using Python by combining and studying data from multiple sources.



**📁 Datasets Used**

Two CSV files are used in this analysis:



* Unemployment\_in\_India.csv
* Unemployment\_Rate\_upto\_11\_2020.csv



Both datasets contain unemployment rate information across different time periods.



**🛠️ Tools \& Libraries**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn



**🔍 Project Workflow**

1\. Data Loading

Loaded both CSV files using Pandas

Previewed datasets to understand structure and columns



2\. Data Cleaning

Cleaned column names

Renamed unemployment rate columns for consistency

Converted date columns to datetime format

Removed missing values



3\. Data Combination

Combined both datasets into a single dataframe

Sorted data chronologically for accurate analysis



4\. Unemployment Trend Analysis

Visualized overall unemployment rate trends over time

Observed changes and fluctuations across years



5\. Covid-19 Impact Analysis

Categorized data into Pre-Covid, Covid, and Post-Covid periods

Compared average unemployment rates across these periods

Used boxplots to visualize the impact of Covid-19



6\. Seasonal Trend Analysis

Extracted month from date

Analyzed average unemployment rate by month

Identified possible seasonal employment patterns



**📈 Key Insights**

* Unemployment increased significantly during the Covid-19 period
* Combining both datasets provides a clearer long-term trend
* Monthly analysis suggests seasonal variations in employment



**📌 Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to clean, combine, analyze, and visualize real-world economic data. It highlights the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment and provides insights into long-term and seasonal trends.
