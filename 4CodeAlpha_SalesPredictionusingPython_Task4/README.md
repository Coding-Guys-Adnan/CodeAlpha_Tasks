**📈 Task 4: Sales Prediction using Python**

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.

The objective of this task is to predict sales based on advertising expenditure across different platforms using machine learning techniques in Python.



**📁 Dataset**

advertising.csv



The dataset contains advertising spend on:

* TV
* Radio
* Newspaper
* The target variable is Sales.



**🛠️ Libraries Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit‑learn



**🔍 Project Workflow**

**1. Data Loading \& Cleaning**

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Removed unnecessary index columns

Checked for missing values



**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyzed relationships between advertising platforms and sales

Used a correlation heatmap to visualize feature relationships



**3. Feature Selection**

Selected TV, Radio, and Newspaper as input features

Defined Sales as the target variable



**4. Model Training**

Split data into training and testing sets



Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data



**5. Model Evaluation**

* Evaluated performance using:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score



**6. Advertising Impact Analysis**

Analyzed the impact of each advertising medium using regression coefficients



**7. Sales Prediction**

Predicted future sales based on sample advertising budgets



**8. Visualization**

Visualized Actual vs Predicted Sales using a scatter plot



**📈 Key Insights**

* TV advertising shows a strong influence on sales
* Regression coefficients help understand the impact of each platform
* Linear Regression provides a simple and effective baseline model
* 

**📌 Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict business outcomes such as sales. It covers the full workflow from data analysis to prediction and helps understand how advertising spend affects sales performance.
